# Model-Based Calibration and Scoring for Oral Reading Fluency Assessment Data with R

`bspam` is an R package that allows model-based calibration and scoring for oral reading fluency (ORF) assessment data.

## Installation:
To install `bspam` package, follow the steps below.

1. The `MultiGHQuad` package needs to be installed. As of May 31, 2022, `MultiGHQuad` package has been removed from CRAN, so download an archive package file from  https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/MultiGHQuad/ and manually install.

2. Install `remotes` package, by running the following R code.
``` {r eval = F}
if(!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("remotes")
```

3. Install `bspam` by running the following R code.
``` {r eval = F}
remotes::install_github("kamataak/bspam")
```

## Basic Usage:
It is recommended that the data are prepared as a long-format data frame, where each row is data for a unique case, namely, a specific passage from a specific student in a specific testing occasion. The data set should minimally contain the following 7 variables: (1) student ID, (2) grade level, (3) testing occasion ID, (4) passage ID, (5) the number of words in the passage, (6) the number of words correctly read for the passage, and (7) time that took to read the passage.  

Variable names and the order of the variables can be flexible in the data frame. When running functions in this package, variable names for required variables need to be specified. 

The `bspam` package comes with several data sets. To demonstrate some basic usage of key functions in the package, an example passage-level student data set `passage2` is used here.   The data set `passage2` is consisted of reading accuracy and time data for 12 passages from 85 students. Although the 85 students were assigned to all 12 passages, the number of passages read by the 85 students varied from 2 to 12 passages. The number of students per passage were between 59 to 79.

Load required packages, and load/view the example data set `passage2`.  
```{r eval = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(bspam)
View(passage2)
```

### Passage Calibration

Calibrate the passages using the `mcem()` function by implementing the Monte Carlo EM algorithm described in Potgieter et al. (2017). 
``` {r eval = F}
MCEM_run <- mcem(stu.data=passage2,
                 studentid = "id.student",
                 passageid = "id.passage",
                 numwords.p = "numwords.pass",
                 wrc = "wrc",
                 time = "sec",
                 k.in = 5,
                 reps.in = 50,
                 est = "mcem")
MCEM_run
```

By default, the standard errors for the model parameters are not estimated. This will allow one to increase the number of Monte-Carlo iterations `reps.in` to improve the quality of the model parameter estimates, while minimizing the computation time. The number of `reps.in` should be 50 to 100 in realistic calibrations. SE's for model parameters are not required for running the `wcpm()` function to estimate WCPM scores in the next step. If standard errors for model parameters are desired, an additional argument `se = "analytical"` or `se = "bootstrap"` needs to be added to the `mcem()` function. 

### Estimating WCPM scores 1

To estimate WCPM scores, we can do in two steps. 

**Step 1:** Prepare the data using the `prep()` function, where required data for the `wcpm()` function are prepared, including changing variable names and a generation of the natural-logarithm of the time data.  

The output from the `prep()` function is a list of two components. The `data.long` component is a data frame, which is a long format of student response data, and the `data.wide` is list that contains four components, including a wide format of the data, as well as other information such as the number of passages and the number of words for each passage.  

One benefit of this two-step approach is that we can use another utility function `get.cases()` to generate a list of unique cases with the output of the `prep()` function. This list can be useful when our interest is to estimate WCPM scores only for selected cases.    

```{r eval = F}
data <- prep(data = passage2,
             studentid = "id.student",
             season = "occasion",
             grade = "grade",
             passageid = "id.passage",
             numwords.p = "numwords.pass",
             wrc = "wrc",
             time = "sec")
```

Generate a list of unique cases:
```{r eval = F}
get.cases(data$data.long)
```

**Step 2:** Run the `wcpm()` function to estimate WCPM scores. Note that we pass the output object `MCEM_run` from the passage calibration phase, as well as the manipulated data `data.long` from Step 1. By default, WCPM scores will be estimated for all cases in the data. Additionally, there are several estimator options and standard error estimation options. In this example, maximum a priori (MAP) estimators for model parameter estimation and analytic approach to estimate standard errors are used.

```{r eval = F}
WCPM_all <- wcpm(calib.data=MCEM_run, 
                 stu.data = data$data.long,
                 est = "map", 
                 se = "analytic")
summary(WCPM_all)
```

If the computations of WCPM scores for only selected cases are desired, we can create a list of cases and provide the list by the `cases =` argument. The list of cases has to be a one-variable data frame with a variable name `cases`. The format of case values should be: `studentid_season`, just like the output of the `get.cases()` function shown earlier in this document.  

```{r eval = F}
sample.cases <- data.frame(cases = c("2033_fall", "2043_fall", "2089_fall"))
WCPM_sample <- wcpm(calib.data=MCEM_run, 
                    stu.data = data$data.long,
                    cases = sample.cases,
                    est = "map", 
                    se = "analytic")
summary(WCPM_sample)
```

Also, we can specify a set of passages to scale the WCPM scores. If WCPM scores are scaled with a set of passages that is different from the set of passages the student read, the set of passages is referred to as an **external passage set**.  

The use of an external passage set is particularly important to make the estimated WCPM scores to be comparable between students who read different sets of passages, as well as within students for longitudinal data, where a student are likely to read different sets of passages.

```{r eval = F}
WCPM_sample_ext1 <- wcpm(calib.data=MCEM_run, 
                         stu.data = data$data.long,
                         cases = sample.cases, 
                         external = c("32004","32010","32015","32016","33003","33037"),
                         est = "map", 
                         se = "analytic")
summary(WCPM_sample_ext1)
```

### Estimating WCPM scores 2

**Alternatively, we can run the `wcpm()` function without Step 1** above, by entering the original data `passage2` directly as follows. 
``` {r eval = F}
WCPM_sample_ext2 <- wcpm(calib.data=MCEM_run, 
                         stu.data = passage2,
                         studentid = "id.student",
                         passageid = "id.passage",
                         season = "occasion",
                         grade = "grade",
                         numwords.p = "numwords.pass",
                         wrc = "wrc",
                         time = "sec",
                         cases = sample.cases, 
                         external = c("32004","32010","32015","32016","33003","33037"),
                         est = "map", 
                         se = "analytic")
summary(WCPM_sample_ext2)
```
