\title{Base function for scoring by likelihood-based approaches}
\usage{
run.scoring(
  object,
  person.data,
  task.data,
  cases,
  perfect.cases,
  est = "map",
  lo = -4,
  hi = 4,
  q = 100,
  kappa = 1,
  external = NULL,
  type = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A class object. Output from calibration phase 
by \code{\link{fit.model}} function.}

\item{person.data}{A data frame. A long-format response data object.}

\item{task.data}{A data frame? Estimated task parameter values?}

\item{cases}{A vector of individual id for which scoring is desired. If no information is 
is specified, it will estimate scores for all cases in the \code{person.data}.}

\item{perfect.cases}{A list? A list of perfect cases.}

\item{est}{Quoted string, indicating the choice of the estimator. It has to be one of 
code/{"mle", "map", "eap", "bayes"}. Default is \code{"map"}.}

\item{lo}{Numeric, indicating the lower bound of the quadratures. Default is -4.}

\item{hi}{Numeric, indicating the upper bound of the quadratures. Default is 4.}

\item{q}{Numeric, indicating the number of quadratures. Default is 100.}

\item{kappa}{Numeric, indicating ?? Default is 1.}

\item{external}{An optional vector of task ID's in strings. If \code{NULL} (default), 
the wcpm scores are derived with the tasks the individuals were assigned to. 
If not \code{NULL}, wcpm scores are derived with the tasks provided in the vector, rather
than the tasks the individuals were assigned.}

\item{type}{Quoted string, indication of the choice of output. If \code{"general"} (default),
wcpm scores are not reported. If \code{"orf"}, wcpm scores will be reported.}
}
\value{
wcpm list
}
\description{
This is a base function for estimating factor scores by likelihood-based 
approaches described in Potgieter et al. (2024). This function is used by 
the \code{\link{scoring}} function, which is recommended for the users to use.
