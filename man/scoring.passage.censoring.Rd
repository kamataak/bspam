It should be K-dimensional}

\item{N:}{A vector of passage lengths
It should be K-dimensional}

\item{sigma:}{The latent standard deviation of the time latent component}

\item{rho:}{The correlation between count and time latent components}

\item{C:}{A vector of indicators whether a specific passage was 
censored (1) or fully observed (0) -- K-dim}
