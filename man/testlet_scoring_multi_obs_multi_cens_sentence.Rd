\description{
Bayesian Sampling Models for Sentence-Level Observations
}
\details{
This code defines Bayesian sampling models for estimating latent variables
based on sentence-level observations for a specific student. The models are
formulated differently depending on the number of censored (incomplete)
and fully observed passages. The goal is to estimate latent variables
such as accuracy (theta_acc) and speed (theta_spd) for the student's
reading performance.
