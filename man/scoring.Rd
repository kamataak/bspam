\title{This is an interface function to call and run scoring or bootstrap.}
\usage{
scoring(
  calib.data = NA,
  person.data = NA,
  person.id = "",
  task.id = "",
  occasion = "",
  group = "",
  max.counts = "",
  obs.counts = "",
  time = "",
  cases = NULL,
  est = "map",
  se = "analytic",
  failsafe = 0,
  bootstrap = 100,
  external = NULL,
  type = "general"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{calib.data}{- fit.model class object from calibration}

\item{person.data}{- individual reading data}

\item{person.id}{The column name in the data that represents the unique individual identifier.}

\item{task.id}{The column name in the data that represents the unique task identifier.}

\item{occasion}{The column name in the data that represents the unique occasion.}

\item{group}{The column name in the data that represents the unique group.}

\item{max.counts}{The column name in the data that represents the number of words in a task.}

\item{obs.counts}{The column name in the data that represents the words read correctly for each case.}

\item{time}{The column name in the data that represents the time, in seconds, for each case.}

\item{cases}{- individual id vectors, will directly use task data if no calib.data provided}

\item{est}{- estimator keyword / c("mle", "map", "eap", "bayes"), default is bayes}

\item{se}{- standard error keyword / c("analytic", "bootstrap"), default is analytic}

\item{failsafe}{- retry time for bootstrap / default 0, can set to 5 ~ 50}

\item{external}{- if not NULL, will use not student read passages for estimating}

\item{type}{- output type, "general" and "orf", default "general" only output tau & theta. "orf" will output wcpm}

\item{bootstrp}{- set K number of bootstrap / default 100}
}
